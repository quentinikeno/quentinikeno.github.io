    <h1>About Me</h1>
    

    <p>My name is Quentin Ikeno and thanks for visiting my data analysis portfolio. This blog was designed as a place to house my projects done for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree in addition to my personal projects involving data science.</p>
<p>I am a college graduate with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics as well as an amateur musician.  While in college, I realized that I could utilize my passion for statistics and coding as a data scientist and thereafter made it my goal to become one.  If you would like to use my skills to create predictions and insights for your business please feel free to contact me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/quentin-ikeno/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
